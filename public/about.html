<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ewaen Osarenkhoe Eric, I am 17years of age, I finished my secondary Education at Pioneer Education Centre.
  I am a developer in training, This actually my first ever Portfolio which i built by only using HTML, in my upcoming lessons,
  i will be thought how to style a website which is done by using a language called CSS which i am not yet familiar with.

In a few months am going to be getting into colledge to study computer science, which is something i actually love, that is
the reason learning how to code doesnt really stress me out because i find it so fascinating and quiet intriging, I'm not
going to lie this coding stuff is quiet challenging for most but i have never really found it difficult before, maybe its 
because HTML is that difficult though. I hope i become the next mack zukerberg and i pray God guide me on this path of mine 
because am ready to do whatever it fucking takes.
